Relationships:
1. Order-Customer Relationship:
Each order is associated with a customer through the CustomerID foreign key in the Orders
table.
2. Order-InventoryItem Relationship:
The OrderDetails table links orders to the items included in each order, using the OrderID
and ItemID.
Data Validation Rules:
1. Order Status Validation:
OrderStatus in the Orders table is restricted to predefined values (e.g., "Pending,"
"Processing," "Shipped," "Delivered") to maintain consistency.
2. Stock Quantity Validation:
StockQuantity in the InventoryItems table must be a non-negative integer to ensure
accurate representation of available stock.
3. Customer Email Format Validation:
The Email attribute in the Customers table is validated against a standard email format to
ensure the correctness of customer email addresses.
4. Foreign Key Constraints:
Foreign key constraints are applied to ensure referential integrity. For example, the
CustomerID in the Orders table must match a valid CustomerID in the Customers table.
REST API Design:
All REST API requests and responses follow the JSON format. The project employs standard HTTP
status codes (200, 201, 400, 404, 401, 500, 505) appropriately in response objects to convey the
outcome of API requests
Http Status Code:
